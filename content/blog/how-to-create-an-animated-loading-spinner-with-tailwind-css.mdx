Creating loading spinners is an easy task with Tailwind CSS. Regardless if you want to add a built-in animated utility class to a spinner icon or if you want to build a spinner that matches your theme, it only takes a few moments to get set up!

## Why Loading Spinners are Important

Our goal as front-end engineers is to make the web fast and beautiful. Sometimes, though, things are out of our control. HTTP calls may take a while to return data, and in those situations, it may be appropriate to show a temporary element to help the user understand the state of their request.

Loading spinners do just that - provide a simple and temporary element to signify a pending state. Without a loading spinner, users may think that their request didn't go through, or that the application or website is broken.

## Tailwind Animation Utility Classes

If you're in a hurry and want a loading spinner quickly, Tailwind CSS has built in animation utility classes to help!

Let's look over each animation utility class and discuss the differences between them.

### The Bounce Animation Utility

First up is the `bounce` utility. This specific utility class can be added to an element to make it jump up and down in an infinite loop.

This can be helpful in various situations, such as:

- Update buttons
- Chat icons
- Incoming notifications
- Scroll down indicators

Here's how easy it is to use the `bounce` utility class:

```html
<svg class="h-6 w-6 animate-bounce ..."><!-- ... --></svg>
```

<iframe height="500" className="w-full" scrolling="no" title="Tailwind Animate Bounce" src="https://codepen.io/braydoncoyer/embed/preview/RwyBNvJ?default-tab=result" frameBorder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowFullScreen={true}>

</iframe>

### The Pulse Animation Utility

Another helpful utility that comes out-of-the-box with Tailwind CSS is the `pulse` class, providing a smooth fade in and fade out animation on the element.

This can be useful in the following situations:

- Creating a skeleton loader animation when the page loads
- Trying to get the attention of the user if there is an update available
- Loading states

Tailwind makes it easy to implement - here's an example:

```html
<div class="h-32 w-64 animate-pulse rounded-xl bg-white shadow-md"></div>
```

<iframe
  height="500"
  className="w-full"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Tailwind Animate Pulse"
  src="https://codepen.io/braydoncoyer/embed/preview/RwyBNzB?default-tab=result"
  frameBorder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowFullScreen={true}
></iframe>

### The Ping Animation Utility

The next animation utility that comes with Tailwind CSS is the `ping` utility class. This is an extremely helpful animation that scales and fades an element to create an animation that has an extremely satisfying result most commonly found on notification badges.

Depending on your use-case, you may need to duplicate the element you want to animate because the ping animation will alter the element on which it is applied.

Once again, the activate this animation, simply apply the utility class to your element:

```html
<!-- Duplicated element with ping utility -->
<div
  class="absolute -left-3 -top-3 h-8 w-8 animate-ping rounded-full bg-indigo-500"
></div>

<div class="absolute -left-3 -top-3 h-8 w-8 rounded-full bg-indigo-500"></div>
```

<iframe
  height="500"
  className="w-full"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Tailwind Animate Ping"
  src="https://codepen.io/braydoncoyer/embed/preview/gOzjpbZ?default-tab=result"
  frameBorder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowFullScreen={true}
></iframe>

### The Spin Animation Utility

Finally, Tailwind CSS provides the `spin` utility class which rotates an element with a linear animation. This specific utility comes in handy with loading spinners!

```html
<svg class="h-12 w-12 animate-spin text-indigo-400" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <!-- ... -->
</svg>
```

<iframe
  height="500"
  className="w-full"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Tailwind Animate Spin"
  src="https://codepen.io/braydoncoyer/embed/preview/YzLjXMb?default-tab=result"
  frameBorder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowFullScreen={true}
></iframe>

The example above uses an SVG from Iconic, but let's look at how to build a custom loading spinner with pure Tailwind CSS!

## Building a Custom Loading Spinner with Tailwind CSS

Building a custom loading spinner can be as simple as adding a few elements to the DOM.

First, create a div, make it a fully rounded circle and feel free to apply a width and height that suits your specific use-case.

```html
<div class="h-14 w-14 rounded-full"></div>
```

In order to make it look like the loader is spinning, we need some form of visual variation. We'll achieve this with a gradient. Feel free to choose your own colors, but here's what I've opted to use:

```html
<div
  class="h-14 w-14 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-tr from-indigo-500 to-pink-500"
></div>
```

Next, we want to transform this element into a ring. One way to do that is to place a smaller circle inside and match the background color.

```html
<div
  class="h-14 w-14 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-tr from-indigo-500 to-pink-500"
>
  <div class="h-9 w-9 rounded-full bg-gray-200"></div>
</div>
```

The only issue is that the inner circle is not center. That's an easy fix with the Tailwind CSS flexbox utility classes!

```html
<div
  class="h-14 w-14 items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-gradient-to-tr from-indigo-500 to-pink-500"
>
  <div class="h-9 w-9 rounded-full bg-gray-200"></div>
</div>
```

The last step is to animate the circle with the gradient applied. Again, Tailwind CSS makes this extremely easy! Just add `animate-spin` to the element, and now we've got a beautiful loading spinner!

<iframe
  height="500"
  className="w-full"
  scrolling="no"
  title="Tailwind CSS Custom Loading Spinner"
  src="https://codepen.io/braydoncoyer/embed/preview/WNJKQQj?default-tab=result"
  frameBorder="no"
  loading="lazy"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowFullScreen={true}
></iframe>

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the various animation utility classes that Tailwind CSS provides and briefly saw some real-word examples. Using the `animate-spin` utility class, we created a custom loading spinner that is completely customizable - all thanks to Tailwind CSS!
