The `:not()` CSS selector is a powerful addition to the pseudo-class toolbelt, allowing you to select elements that are omitted by its argument.

## A basic :not() CSS Selector Example

Here’s an example. I have a few classes set up - one applies base styles for all buttons, one sets the styles of a primary button, and another determines what a primary disabled button should look like.

  I’m using SCSS in the example below to gain the benefit of class nesting and
  variables, but the application of the `:not()` selector is the same.

```scss
.button {
  border: none;
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-top: 1rem;
}

.button--primary {
  background: $button--primary;
  color: white;
}

.button--disabled {
  background: $button--disabled;
  cursor: auto;
}
```

In order to align with accessibility, it’s important that the background of the button changes when in `hover` state. That’s simple enough; here’s the change.

```scss
.button--primary:hover {
  background: $button-primary-hover;
}
```

But, after adding the `:hover` selector, we run into a problem. Try hovering over the disabled button and notice that the background changes as if we were hovering over an active primary button.

How do we get around this? The `:not()` selector makes this an easy fix, allowing the change to only affect primary buttons that are _not_ disabled!

```scss
.button--primary:hover:not(.button--disabled) {
  background: $button-primary-hover;
}
```

  Instead of using a class to determine if the button is disabled, I could have
  opted to use the `:disabled` attribute. I think the examples above are a bit
  easier to follow.

## Browser Compatibility for the :not Selector

Thankfully, the `:not()` selector is supported by most major browsers.
