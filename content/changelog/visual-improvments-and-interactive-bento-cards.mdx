This update is packed with exciting visual enhancements! I've fine-tuned the maximum width for article text, ensured consistent spacing between elements and page sections, and brought interactivity to my bento cards through the amazing new Framer Component Effects!

Additionally, I've incorporated captivating page transition effects. I'm getting ready for the official launch next month, and I can't wait to share it with you!
