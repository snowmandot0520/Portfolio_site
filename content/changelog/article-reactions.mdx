My blog has featured a built-in reaction system for years now. It might seem a bit unconventional for a typical blog, but I love how it adds a social dimension and showcases my personality.

For this year's version, I've selected four distinct reactions: Like, Love, Celebrate, and Insightful. Each comes with its own custom icon and subtle micro-interaction for that extra polish.

These small details make the reading experience more engaging while letting readers share their thoughts with just a click.
